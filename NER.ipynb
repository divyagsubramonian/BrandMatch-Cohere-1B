Now, there's a lot more selection and what I've noticed is I'm selling more than non-alcoholic beer and wine now instead of the non-alcoholic spirits. It's not just Monday because I got more than one. That's kind of what I'm seeing now. But no one's ever complained or anything that it's no good. Everyone that's tried all that stuff liked them. Most people complain about anything non-alcoholic that costs over $20, but they understand because when I explain it to them, how it's made, that makes sense. I can tell you from experience, the reason that stuff's in here is because of me. I've been sober for over ten years, and when I found all that stuff, I started bringing it in because they changed the law and we could sell it. Taste wise, it's like most of them all kind of taste similar in a way. I wouldn't say it's exactly whiskey, but it has a pretty decent taste to where if you mixed it, or even I drink it straight, it's just fine on the rocks. It could always taste more like alcohol, but that's hard to do when you're taking the alcohol out. I don't find it hard to drink, and I used to drink whiskey all the time. Whiskey and Scotch. I'm not saying it's exactly like that, but it's definitely better than about six or seven others I could name, but I won't. But it's definitely top 2 easy.\",\n          \"Honestly, it\\u2019s so much better now that we\\u2019ve started doing demos every month and checking expiration dates. The initial batch might have had short expiration dates or it could have been a new product that people weren\\u2019t familiar with. After we started doing the demos, it began to move. It's pretty good now with pushing from the owner as a schedule to do the demo at least one or two times a month.

Now, there's a lot more selection and what I've noticed is I'm selling more than non-alcoholic beer and wine now instead of the non-alcoholic spirits. It's not just Monday because I got more than one. That's kind of what I'm seeing now. But no one's ever complained or anything that it's no good. Everyone that's tried all that stuff liked them. Most people complain about anything non-alcoholic that costs over $20, but they understand because when I explain it to them, how it's made, that makes sense. I can tell you from experience, the reason that stuff's in here is because of me. I've been sober for over ten years, and when I found all that stuff, I started bringing it in because they changed the law and we could sell it. Taste wise, it's like most of them all kind of taste similar in a way. I wouldn't say it's exactly whiskey, but it has a pretty decent taste to where if you mixed it, or even I drink it straight, it's just fine on the rocks. It could always taste more like alcohol, but that's hard to do when you're taking the alcohol out. I don't find it hard to drink, and I used to drink whiskey all the time. Whiskey and Scotch. I'm not saying it's exactly like that, but it's definitely better than about six or seven others I could name, but I won't. But it's definitely top 2 easy.\",\n          \"Honestly, it\\u2019s so much better now that we\\u2019ve started doing demos every month and checking expiration dates.

Now, there's a lot more selection and what I've noticed is I'm selling more than non-alcoholic beer and wine now instead of the non-alcoholic spirits. It's not just Monday because I got more than one. That's kind of what I'm seeing now. But no one's ever complained or anything that it's no good. Everyone that's tried all that stuff liked them. Most people complain about anything non-alcoholic that costs over $20, but they understand because when I explain it to them, how it's made, that makes sense. I can tell you from experience, the reason that stuff's in here is because of me. I've been sober for over ten years, and when I found all that stuff, I started bringing it in because they changed the law and we could sell it. Taste wise, it's like most of them all kind of taste similar in a way. I wouldn't say it's exactly whiskey, but it has a pretty decent taste to where if you mixed it, or even I drink it straight, it's just fine on the rocks. It could always taste more like alcohol, but that's hard to do when you're taking the alcohol out. I don't find it hard to drink, and I used to drink whiskey all the time. Whiskey and Scotch. I'm not saying it's exactly like that, but it's definitely better than about six or seven others I could name, but I won't. But it's definitely top 2 easy.\",\n          \"Honestly, it\\u2019s so much better now that we\\u2019ve started doing demos every month and checking expiration dates.

Now, there's a lot more selection and what I've noticed is I'm selling more than non-alcoholic beer and wine now instead of the non-alcoholic spirits. It's not just Monday because I got more than one. That's kind of what I'm seeing now. But no one's ever complained or anything that it's no good. Everyone that's tried all that stuff liked them. Most people complain about anything non-alcoholic that costs over $20, but they understand because when I explain it to them, how it's made, that makes sense. I can tell you from experience, the reason that stuff's in here is because of me. I've been sober for over ten years, and when I found all that stuff, I started bringing it in because they changed the law and we could sell it. Taste wise, it's like most of them all kind of taste similar in a way. I wouldn't say it's exactly whiskey, but it has a pretty decent taste to where if you mixed it, or even I drink it straight, it's just fine on the rocks. It could always taste more like alcohol, but that's hard to do when you're taking the alcohol out. I don't find it hard to drink, and I used to drink whiskey all the time. Whiskey and Scotch. I'm not saying it's exactly like that, but it's definitely better than about six or seven others I could name, but I won't.

The other flavors, they're terrible. Peanut butter ones, bestsellers - big bags, small bag, doesn't matter. The other ones sold, but they took a little while to sell out. But the peanut butter cup, sometimes I would get two cases of each every week, so they go up fast. As a seller, I would love to get more promo prices, but from the customers, no complaints. Sometimes the big bags, maybe a little bit too pricey because we sell it for $8.99. Maybe if the cost price could go down for a little bit, it would be more appealing.\n","Review 1: It sells pretty well, I would say fairly average for like a candy kind of chocolate treat.\n","Cluster 1\n","Review 0: We do carry it, but we're currently out of stock. It's selling very well, so much so that we need to place a new order. It's selling out quickly, which is why we're out right now. At the moment, we only have one flavor available, but if we get approval for additional flavors, we’re open to exploring that option.\n","Review 1: We still carry Whims, and it's selling well. Among the flavors, the peanut butter cups are the most popular and sell the fastest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n","Cluster 0\n","Review 0: We do carry Whims chocolate, but we haven’t ordered it recently because it melts in the summer heat. We'll bring it back in the fall when the weather is cooler. When we had it, it sold really well, so we’re planning to place an order for the fall. The chocolate is very popular here, but its quality isn’t as good when it melts.\\n\n","Review 1: It's about half gone. It's selling and we haven't gotten any complaints but I don't think it's been rebought repeatedly.\n","Cluster 5\n","Review 0: Very good. All the flavors are selling fast. I tried it a few times. Customers seem to like it, too. The packaging is very nice and your salesman is a very good guy, too.\n","Review 1: We're doing very well. Selling very well. Everything's good. It's put on the shelf, it sells out, so we're doing good. There seemed to be a hit with the customers, so not really any bad feedback at all.\n","Cluster 3\n","Review 0: We love sharing Whims with our customers! The taste is smooth and milky, but surprisingly dairy free! It is great to be able to offer our customer a great vegan chocolate. Cute packaging too!\n","Review 1: Love the black matcha!\n","Cluster 4\n","Review 0: We're a little island in the middle of two major cities and spring starting to come in more and summer is going to come up. So we're not quite there yet on getting another order in, but right now we're just going to hold off. They do like them. We like them. They're good quality. The owner prefers to have a nice, good quality product. So these are something that's right up our alley. And because we are the little island out in the middle of nowhere, people do source out here. But we're only a couple years into the business, so it's just getting to people to know where the store is, and once they come in, they know it.\n","Review 1: It's doing well. The little ones do really well for us, too - the individual cups. The package is nice. The price is a little high for them, but everything is expensive nowadays but everything is good with it. If you could just bring the price down a little bit, that would be it.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"s-YrFSGUHNX6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Topic Modeling"],"metadata":{"id":"r7VWOsDOLMxO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\n","import pandas as pd\n","import nltk\n","\n","# Ensure required NLTK resources are downloaded\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","\n","# Preprocessing function\n","def preprocess_text(text):\n","    import re\n","    from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","    text = re.sub(r'\\W', ' ', text)  #
